# About

This website contains the draft specification of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (Beta-2 version) plus support for its use.

The Standard is being developed under the guidance of OpenOwnership. More details about the organisation are available at [www.openownership.org](http://www.openownership.org).

<h2>Current status of the standard</h2>

   :alt: Timeline of standard development. End of 2016: rapid prototype. 2017, Q2: release of BODS Beta-1. 2017, Q3: initital pilots. 2018, Q3: release of BODS Beta-2. 2019: release of BODS v1.0.

```
This is Beta-2 of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard. The data model has been updated and additional codelist information added since Beta-1.

Implementers should be aware that future changes are anticipated, before a version 1.0 release. However, from this beta release onwards, any structural changes or major definitional changes will only take place following consultation. A clear [changelog](changelog) will be provided, and the documentation of previous versions maintained in archive form.

The schema contains a structure, fields and codelists but does not yet enforce validation constraints on most fields.

<h2>Get involved</h2>

All changes to the standard draft, documentation and specification take place via GitHub at [https://github.com/openownership/data-standard/](https://github.com/openownership/data-standard/).

Suggestions for changes can be made via the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/openownership/data-standard/issues).

If you would like to be involved in the development and review of the Standard, see the [Governance](governance.md) page.
