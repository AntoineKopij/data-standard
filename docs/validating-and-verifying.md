Validating and verifying data
=============================

In order to be useful, the data that is published will need to be validated. There are two areas of validation that can be planned for in the producing data phase.

<h2>Validation against the standard</h2>
For interoperability with other publishers data, and to allow for common data analysis tools, releases in JSON format should validate against the version of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard schema used to produce the data. Any serialisations to other formats should be tested to ensure that the data is correctly represented.

For now, generic JSON schema validation tools should be used to test for correctness. In the future, custom validation tools will be made available to test the correctness of JSON outputs and serialisation to flat file formats.

<h2>Pre-validation of data during collection</h2>
