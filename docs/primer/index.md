This Primer sets out to explain the basics of Beneficial Ownership and the basics of a data standard handling Beneficial Ownership.

People new to the concept of Beneficial Ownership will want to know [what it is](whatisbo) and [why it's important](whyisbo). Looking then at [what data is needed](whatisbodata) to describe a Beneficial Ownership chain, we can [understand the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard](whatisthebods) as a kind of template. Finally we look at the [scope of the Standard](whatdoesbodscover) and what it offers.
