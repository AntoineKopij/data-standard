# What is beneficial ownership data?

Data relating to beneficial ownership is often included in companies’ annual reports, founding articles and filings to regulatory authorities. Bringing it all together can build the big picture about a company’s beneficial owners.

The data may include:

* Details of individuals
* Details of other legal entities
* A breakdown of share holdings 
* Explanation of voting rights
* Details of intermediate entities in an ownership chain
* Rules of board membership 

And so on.

But accessing this data and understanding its relevance to beneficial ownership can be challenging. The data may only be small part of a longer document. The same types of data will be represented differently by different publishers. Relevant data may appear across different documents.

And increasingly, governments and regulatory authorities require beneficial ownership data to be disclosed and filed in official registers.

These challenges require us to structure and standardise beneficial ownership data, so that it has a reliable scope and predictable format.
