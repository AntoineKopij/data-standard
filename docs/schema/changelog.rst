    Changelog under development.


This is beta 2 of the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard. It includes updates to the data model and additional codelist information.

Implementers should be aware that future changes are anticipated, before a version 1.0 release. However, from this beta release onwards, any structural changes, or major definitional changes will only take place following consultation, with a clear changelog provided, and with the documentation of previous versions maintained in archive form.

The schema specifies a **structure**, **fields** and **codelists** but does not yet enforce validation constraints on most fields.
