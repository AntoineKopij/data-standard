Data Schema
===========

This data schema sets out how beneficial ownership data **must** (or **should**) be structured and formatted in order to :any:`conform <conformance>` to the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS).

People working on data management systems implementing BODS will want to understand the [concepts](modelling-beneficial-ownership-info.md) on which the standard is modelled. The [schema browser](data-schema-browser.md) provides a way of digging through the schema's structure, showing how its objects and fields fit together. Alternatively, the [schema reference](data-schema-reference.md) presents these elements and their descriptions in easy-to-reference tables. Further considerations regarding the validation, publishing, and lifecycle of data are included as [technical requirements](technical-requirements.md).

        **Must** and **should** are used in the schema to denote required and recommended elements of the Standard, as defined in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
