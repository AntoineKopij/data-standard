Data Schema
===========

This data schema sets out how beneficial ownership data **must** (or **should**) be structured and formatted in order to :doc:`conform <conformance>` to the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS).

People working on data management systems implementing BODS will want to understand the :any:`concepts <key-concepts>` on which the standard is modelled. The :doc:`schema browser <schema-browser>` provides a way of digging through the schema's structure, showing how its objects and fields fit together. Alternatively, the :doc:`schema reference <reference>` presents these elements and their descriptions in easy-to-reference tables. 

Further considerations regarding the validation, publishing, and lifecycle of data are included as [technical requirements](technical-requirements.md).

        **Must** and **should** are used in the schema to denote required and recommended elements of the Standard, as defined in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
