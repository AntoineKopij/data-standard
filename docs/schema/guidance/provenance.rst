Sources and annotations
=======================

It is important to indicate clearly where data has come from, and any changes to it that have been made since it was originally collected. 

The ``source`` object in each statement can be used to provide provenance information.

The ``annotations`` object in each statement can be used to provide additional contextual information at the level of a whole statement, an object, or an individual field.
