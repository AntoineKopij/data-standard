# What does the Data Standard cover?

<h2>A broad, flexible range of fields and options...</h2>

The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard allows publishers to include:

* Identifiers and details for individuals
* Identifiers and details for companies
* Types and levels of involvement in companies
* Provenance information
* Historical, as well as current, information
* Placeholders, when information must be redacted

<h2>... meets the diverse needs of publishers and data users.</h2>

The design[LINK to concept model] of the Standard allows:

* Changes to beneficial ownership information to be tracked over time.
* Competing claims about beneficial ownership to be considered alongside one another.
* Publishers to use whatever definition of beneficial ownership is relevant to them.

Although the data Standard is not a data model for the storage of beneficial ownership information, it can inform the design of data collection and storage systems. A set of functional requirements[LINK] for such databases and systems is available for this purpose.

In order to enable worldwide use of the Standard, thresholds for meeting beneficial ownership criteria are undefined. Instead, each statement of beneficial ownership expressed using the Standard describes the degree of ownership or control.

    The Standard is well-defined yet flexible: as suited for use by national registers of beneficial ownership as by corporate researchers.
