# Why beneficial ownership is a useful concept

People can be involved in a number of companies and in different ways. By limiting our understanding of people's involvement to ownership only, we would miss instances like below.

![Person A controls 60% of Company 2 indirectly. And Person A owns 50% of Company 3](_assets/Diag4-complexInvolve.svg)

The person both controls Company 2 indirectly and owns half of Company 3. This could be important to know if both companies bidded for the same government contract, or if they both appeared in a procurement chain.

    Uniting ownership and control under the banner of beneficial ownership allows us to represent the complex reality of corporate structures.
